    <h1>NBA’s Mount Rushmore: MJ, Kareem, Magic, LeBron, Shaq, Bird, Kobe?</h1>
    <h2>By: S.Kabir</h2>

    <img src="mount.png">
    <p>Mount Rushmore, located in Pennington County, South Dakota, features sculptures of four of the greatest Presidents 
        in U.S history. Some people may argue the Presidents that followed George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, 
        Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln may have had a larger impact, but that’s why this analogy works 
        so well with the NBA. Every generation going forward may believe they have seen the best players to pass
         through the NBA and that the “Mount Rushmore” of the NBA is cemented. However, every now and then, 
         a generational talent emerges and changes the entire landscape of the NBA. Bringing up the conversation 
         of NBA’s greatest of all time (also referred to as G.O.A.T) is a topic of contention, since so many players
          have come through the NBA in different eras therefore it’s hard to compare. Below is the list of my MT.Rushmore
           players and why they made my list over some other great players:
